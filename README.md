# NOAA_Precipitation_Prediction
In this project we aim to predict the amount of monthly average precipitation in various locations throughtout Germany and Sweden.<br>
The project is split into three parts:
<ol>
<li>ETL - Streaming weather data using Kafka, transforming it using PySpark and eventually storing it in MSSQL Database.</li>
<li>Data Analysis - Using our stored data to preform evalutations, feature selection and feature engineering on our data in preparation of fitting a model to it. </li>
<li>Learning - Fitting a few models onto our data and getting final predictions. </li>
</ol>
Additionaly, we preformed another task which is finding evidence of global warming.
